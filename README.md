# 📘 Classroom Attendance Tracker (Java)

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Classroom Attendance Tracker** is a simple, console-based Java application designed to record and analyze student attendance over a specified number of working days.  
It helps in calculating **total attendance**, **attendance percentage**, and identifying **defaulters** based on a minimum attendance requirement.

This project is ideal for **students learning Java arrays**, loops, and basic input/output operations.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- To maintain daily attendance records of students.
- To calculate attendance percentage automatically.
- To identify students who are **eligible** or **defaulters**.
- To demonstrate the use of **1D and 2D arrays** in Java.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Language:** Java  
- **Concepts:** Arrays, Loops, Conditional Statements, Scanner Class  
- **IDE:** VS Code / IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse (Any Java IDE)

## 📂 Project Structure

---
  ##SAMPLE OUTPUT
## 📥 Input Details
- Number of students
- Number of working days
- Student names
- Attendance for each student:
  - `1` → Present
  - `0` → Absent

---

## 📤 Output Details
The program generates a **final attendance report** displaying:
- Student Name
- Day-wise attendance
- Total days present
- Attendance percentage
- Status (Eligible / Defaulter)

---

## ⚙️ Algorithm
1. Start the program.
2. Input number of students.
3. Input number of working days.
4. Store student names in a 1D array.
5. Store attendance in a 2D array.
6. Accept attendance for each student for each day.
7. Calculate total attendance and percentage.
8. Display eligibility status based on attendance percentage.
9. End the program.

---

## 📊 Attendance Criteria
- Minimum **75% attendance** is required.
- Students below 75% are marked as **DEFAULTER**.
- Students with 75% or more are marked as **Eligible**.

---

## ✅ Advantages
- Simple and user-friendly.
- Reduces manual attendance calculation.
- Demonstrates real-life use of arrays.
- Ideal for academic mini-projects.
- Easy to modify and extend.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations
- No data persistence (data is not saved).
- No input validation.
- Console-based interface only.
- Suitable only for small-scale usage.

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Add file handling or database support.
- Implement a GUI using Swing or JavaFX.
- Add attendance summary reports.
- Include input validation.
- Extend for monthly or yearly attendance tracking.

---

## 🧪 Sample Run

   Enter number of students: 2
Enter number of working days: 3

Student Names:
Amit
Riya

Attendance:
1 1 0
1 0 1

Output:
Amit → 66.7% → DEFAULTER
Riya → 66.7% → DEFAULTER


---

## 📌 Conclusion
The **Classroom Attendance Tracker** is a beginner-friendly Java project that effectively demonstrates array usage and basic logic implementation.  
It can be extended into a complete attendance management system with advanced features.
